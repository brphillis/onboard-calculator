## Data Input Choices

The Best Bank Onboarding Page collects various types of information to facilitate a smooth onboarding process. Here's an overview of the reasons behind each data input choice:

- **Personal Information:** Collecting personal information is essential for identification and contact purposes. It allows us to accurately create and maintain staff members' profiles.
- **Employment Information:** Gathering job-related information helps us set up new staff members' profiles in the payroll and HR systems accurately. This ensures smooth salary processing and HR administration.
- **Tax and Superannuation Information:** Including a tax file number (TFN) enables us to calculate the appropriate tax deductions for staff members. Collecting superannuation fund details and account numbers allows us to process superannuation contributions accurately.
- **Bank Account Information:** Bank account details are necessary for seamless salary payments to staff members' accounts.
- **Emergency Contact Information:** In case of any emergencies, having the contact details of a trusted person can help us reach out to the staff member's designated contact quickly and efficiently.
